This Python script demonstrates the implementation of a Random Forest classifier for predicting customer churn based on a dataset stored in the 'Churn_Modelling.csv' file. The code utilizes popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

The initial preprocessing steps involve converting categorical data, specifically the 'Gender' column, into numerical format using a lambda function. Additionally, the 'Geography' column is one-hot encoded using the sklearn ColumnTransformer and OneHotEncoder, treating it as the first column. The dataset is then split into feature variables (X) and the target variable (y).

Following this, the script performs a train-test split, allocating 75% of the data for training the model and 25% for testing. Standardization is applied to the feature variables using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn, ensuring that all input features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

The core of the script involves the implementation of a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees, specified by the 'n_estimators' parameter. The model is trained on the standardized training data, and predictions are generated for the test set. The accuracy and confusion matrix of the model are then calculated using scikit-learn's metrics module.

In terms of performance evaluation, the confusion matrix provides a breakdown of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, offering insights into the model's ability to correctly classify instances. The accuracy score quantifies the overall correctness of the model's predictions.

Users can use this script as a template for implementing a Random Forest classifier for customer churn prediction in their own datasets by adjusting parameters, loading different data, or incorporating additional preprocessing steps based on the characteristics of their specific dataset.
