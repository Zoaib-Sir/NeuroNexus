# NeuroNexus
Welcome to my NeuroNexus repository! Here, you'll find two intriguing projects showcasing diverse applications of machine learning and data analysis.

### Fraud Detection using SVM
Discover a sophisticated fraud detection system implemented using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The script, residing in the 'Fraud_Detection' folder, leverages transaction data from 'fraudTrain.csv' and 'fraudTest.csv' to train an SVM model for identifying potential fraudulent activities. The code involves data preprocessing, label encoding of categorical variables, and model training, providing a glimpse into the world of anomaly detection in financial transactions.

### Customer Churn Prediction with Random Forest
Delve into the realm of customer relationship management with the 'Customer_Churn_Prediction' project. Located in the corresponding folder, this script utilizes a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn based on a dataset stored in 'Churn_Modelling.csv'. The code showcases essential steps such as data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, model training, and performance evaluation, offering insights into building a robust churn prediction system.

Feel free to explore each project's respective folder to access the source code, datasets, and any additional documentation. Whether you're a data science enthusiast or a professional seeking practical examples, these projects provide valuable insights into applying machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios. Happy exploring!
